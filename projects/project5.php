<h2>Preliminary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Due Date:</strong>  TBD by midnight</li>
  <li>This is a partner assignment. Knowing how to collaborate and work on teams is a vital skill that a computer scientist must learn.</li>
  <li>To avoid losing 15 points, you must complete this assignment with a classmate and you must both submit the same solution to the CS GDrive.</li>
  <li>To avoid losing an additional 5 points, explain your contributions to the solution in the CS GDrive comment box.</li>

<h3>The Fox Lyrics - 100 points</h3>
<p>Ylvis' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE">music video</a> entitled "The Fox" went viral in September 2013 and has been viewed more than 545 million times!</p>
<p>Your assignment is to use loops to minimize repeated words and phrases of "The Fox" that appear in <a href="http://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/joy-and-beauty/assignments/hw4/Fox.py">Fox.py.</a></p>

<h2>Requirements and Grading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>35 points - There are seven lines that have repeated words in them. Use loops to eliminate the repeated words. (5 points per line.)</li>
  <li>40 points - There are two sets of consecutive lines that repeat. Use loops to eliminate these repetitions. (20 points per set.)</li>
  <li>10 points - The Python solution is easy to understand and does not contain unnecessary code.</li>
  <li>15 points - The lyrics to "The Fox" print out exactly the same way that they do in this <a href="fox.py">starting solution</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Place the solution in a file named <strong>Fox.py</strong> and submit it in the CS GDrive no later than midnight on Friday, TBD.</p>
