<h2>Preliminary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Due Date:</strong>  TBD by midnight</li>
  <li>You must complete this assignment individually.</li>
  <li>Note: You might have the opportunity to demonstrate your creation in class on TBD.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2>Special Topics - 100 points</h2>
<p>Create a Python program that does something fun and interesting. The program should reflect both what you have learned in this class, as well as your prior experience with computational thinking. Have fun!</p>

<h3>Requirements and Grading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>20 points -The program works as intended.</li>
  <li>20 points -The program impresses your peers.</li>
  <li>40 points -The program is sophisticated, reflecting your computational thinking and Python programming experience.</li>
  <li>5 points - Place a comment at the top of the file that describes what the program is intended to do.</li>
  <li>15 points - The Python code is properly commented, easy to understand and doesn't contain significant redundancies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>Place the solution in a file named <strong>Final_Project.py</strong> and submit it to the CS GDrive no later than midnight on TBD. Late submissions will receive no credit, but partial credit can be earned by making an ontime submission.</p>
